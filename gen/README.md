Scripts to generate test cases.

### Setup

Standard Python3 scripts that use SciPy to generate matrices. Your system interpreter should work, but if not:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

`generate_test_matrices.py` output is already checked in so you likely won't have to use it unless you modify it to
create new tests:

```bash
python3 generate_test_matrices.py
```
