# Benchmarks

Uses the [Google Benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark) library, which itself uses the [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) library.

Both are included here as git submodules.

If your `benchmark/` and `googletest/` are empty, use the following to fetch them:

```bash
git submodule update --init 
```
